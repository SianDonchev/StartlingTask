# Nine Letter Word Reducer

A Java program that finds all nine-letter English words that can be reduced to single-letter words ("I" or "A") by removing one letter at a time, with each reduction resulting in a valid English word.

## Problem Description

Given a nine-letter word, the program verifies if:
1. Removing one letter results in a valid 8-letter word
2. From that 8-letter word, removing one letter results in a valid 7-letter word
3. This process continues until reaching a single-letter word
4. The only valid single-letter words are "I" and "A"
